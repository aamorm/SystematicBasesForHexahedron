Demonstration of Second-Order Nédélec Curl-Conforming Hexahedral element
===

The main executable is `mainHalfFilled.m`, that generates from scratch the
basis functions and use them to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem
used for verification in the numerical results (specifically, a half-filled
cavity). This script also shows the coefficients for the different basis
shown in Table II.
