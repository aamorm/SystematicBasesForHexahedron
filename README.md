Demonstration of Second-Order Nédélec Curl-Conforming Hexahedral element
===

The main executable is `mainHalfFilled.m`, that generates from scratch the
basis functions and use them to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem
used for verification in the numerical results (specifically, a half-filled
cavity). 

Also, we have a main executable to generate only the basis functions, 
`mainGenerateCoefficients`, and another main executable, `mainEvaluateCoefficients` 
to evaluate the basis functions from the coefficients shown in Table II.
